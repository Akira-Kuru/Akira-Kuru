## 🎨 Other interesting things about me!

Beyond coding, I'm a returning **artist** and **musician**. My artistic focus has been primarily on **pixel art**, though I've been leaning towards **digital art** as of lately. I used to play the **electric guitar** and have recently picked up an **acoustic guitar** to explore a range of musical styles.

Additionally, I've expanded my knowledge into the social creative aspect of the internet by editing videos for content creators using **Adobe Premiere Pro**. I'm experienced in the Adobe Suite which adds to my creative nature.
